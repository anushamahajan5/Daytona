This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Calendar App with Daytona

This is a sample project that demonstrates the integration of Daytona for managing a seamless development environment.
## Overview
The Calendar App is a React-based single-page application that allows users to view and interact with a calendar, add and manage events, and customize event details. The app provides functionalities such as month navigation, event scheduling with time validation, event categorization (e.g., Work, Personal, Others), and real-time updates to the event list.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Daytona: `npm install -g daytona`.
3. Create the development environment: `daytona create`.
4. Open the project in a development container (VSCode will prompt you).
5. Run the app: `npm run dev`.
